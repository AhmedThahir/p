Refugee population across the world
1. Show > 1 million back and front
	> "The refugees rush over to the neighboring countries"
1. Intake of refugees increases the demands for health services, infrastructure, and transportation. The host nation must be able to cope with the new increase in demand.
1. Both intake and non-intake leads to pressure by the common people, which is a tricky situation of the govt.
1. When refugees do manage to escape to a foreign country, those countries face immense pressure from China to return would-be refugees
1. How countries deal with refugees shows realism
</aside></section><section><h1>International Waters</h1><div class="rs"><img data="chinaSea.png"></div><aside>1. China builds artificial islands and sets up military bases in the South China Sea. China insists that its intentions are non-militaristic, but its actions say otherwise
1. China does this in order to extract the natural resources of those regions and to simultaneously prevent other countries from doing so. Moreover, they avail more efficient trading routes.
1. Moreover, China is taking charge of Tibet's waters, which affects Indian population, which obviously is an international concern, as there is possibility for conflict
</aside></section><section><h1>Investment & Debt</h1><div class="rs"><img data="Hambantota.jpg"><img data="africa.png"></div><aside>as the Japanese guest lecturer said, China is doing a lot of propaganda

1. once the country gets crippled by tempting loans, it becomes a puppet for China and its expansion
	1. Sri Lanka could repay loans
		1. China demanded the port as collateral
	1. China has invested in **every** african country except Swaziland
1. allies through financial means, not through military support
	1. slowly displacing the US as the 'big brother' in many countries
</aside></section><section><h1>Biowarfare</h1><div class="rs"><img data="wuhan.jpg"></div><aside>1. It seems very suspicious that the origin of the virus was from Wuhan, the same place where there is a research center for virology(Wuhan Institute of Virology).
1. Moreover, the fact that China hid the news of the outbreak supports the theory even further.
1. One possibility is that China used the virus to cripple the rest of the world, as no country was even prepared for the possibility of a pandemic. Countries’ economies, healthcare, education system, and other sectors were heavily tested; many countries were just not able to cope.
1. Also, isn't it very suspicious that the most affected countries are China's major competitors - US

1. There is risk of China using digital means to manipulate people of other countries, just like the Cambridge Analytica scandal
1. A well-known example would be of the social media app Tiktok, with many reports suggesting that it was just spyware
1. According to Mandiant, an American cybersecurity firm,
	> We believe that APT1 is able to wage such a long-running and extensive cyber espionage campaign in large part because it receives direct government support.
1. Previous speakers have already talked about how dependent countries are on digitizing
1. African Union spying

1. Products made through exploited labor should be boycotted, to hinder the Government’s efforts at exploiting workers. Even if a company does produce goods in China, it should ensure that employees and laborers avail good working conditions.
1. New laws and heavy penalties must be set up for cyber crimes, as it could have serious repercussions if left as is.
1. There must be stricter laws for governing international waters, to ensure that China doesn’t just bully its neighbors.
1. China's microbiology research must be monitored to ensure that their bioweapons are kept in check and other countries can be prepared in the case of an ‘accidental’ leak.
1. Other countries should support countries that are under the BRI, in order to reduce China’s dominance over them.
1. International companies should find alternative countries to produce their goods. It may not be easy, but it is necessary to reduce the current dependence on China.

Various other countries have been involved in cyber scandals and tampering incidents; Russia, for instance, has been accused of tampering in the 2016 US Presidential Elections.
1. BRI
	1. There are reports which show that Chinese lenders are willing to re-negotiate loan terms.
	1. There are many countries where the standard of living has improved due to Chinese investment, namely in Lesotho
1. Despite claims that Covid-19 was a bioweapon, it hasn’t been confirmed yet and there is a possibility that it was genuinely just an accidental leak. Hence, unless it has been proved, China can’t exactly be pronounced guilty.
1. Despite extensive militarization, China limits its use of violence (especially other countries' civillians), which is in stark contrast to the US’ expeditions for resources.
1. Finally, online resources are heavily backed by Western media; they show only the Westerners’ side of the story, and China is portrayed as 'the' super villain. Even for the reseach for this project, I could only find a few media outlets talking about the other perspective.</aside></section></section></div></div><script src="./../../backend/custom/js/custom.js"></script><script src="./../../backend/reveal.js-master/dist/reveal.js"></script><script>set_themes("black")
